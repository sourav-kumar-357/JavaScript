# 🚀 JavaScript Mastery Repository

Welcome to my **JavaScript learning repository**! This is where I’m building my foundation in JavaScript—from basic syntax to advanced concepts—through structured examples, real-world snippets, and focused practice.

## 👩‍💻 About Me

Hi! I'm **Sourav Kumar**, a B.Tech student at **UCET Hazaribagh (CSE branch)**, graduating in **2028**. While my background is in Electronics and Communication, I’m deeply passionate about **software development** and actively transitioning into the tech world.

I’m currently learning:
- 📌 **Java + DSA** (GeeksforGeeks, Self-paced)
- 🌐 **Web Development** (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React)
- ⚙️ **Backend Development** (Node.js, Express, MongoDB – in progress)

This repo is part of my self-learning journey and preparation for **internships, hackathons, and off-campus placements** by my 6th semester.
